HTML documentation for the Cuddl project may be generated from the
reStructuredText source files in this directory using the Sphinx
documentation tool.

These instructions describe how to set up a working Sphinx installation:

  https://www.codecraftsmen.org/sphinx-notes.html

Once you have activated the virtual Python environment and installed the
required packages, the Cuddl documentation can be built by typing the
following command in this directory:

  make html

You may then open the top-level HTML file in a web browser:

  _build/html/index.html
